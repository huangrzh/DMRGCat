# DMRGCat 
DMRGCat is a basical DMRG algorithm implementation written in c++.
DMRGCat is model dependant at present. But its generalization to other models is not difficult.
It includes classes
  U1Q
  BlockQBase
  QMat
  Block
  SuperBlock
  
DMRGCat requires armadillo(http://arma.sourceforge.net/) and c++11.
